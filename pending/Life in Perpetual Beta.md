## Abstract:
When we release a beta version of a product, we generally understand it will have bugs. And we're okay with that, because hey — it's not the final product. We're testing and learning and gathering insights that will improve the future product.
What if we applied this same principle to our lives? What could we achieve and experience if we adopted the mindset of being in "perpetual beta"?

"Beta" is about focusing on progress, not perfection. Now is the perfect time to embrace this. We'll discuss how to iterate on aspects of our lives we're unhappy with, how to practice deploying early and often, and how to courageously pivot when user testing shows we've gone astray.
