## Abstract:
Javascript frameworks get a bad rap when it comes to accessibility. But is it the frameworks creating the barriers, or us as the developers?

Follow me on a React journey through div soup, past the lost focus and under the unchanged titles. Find out: is there actually anything in React preventing us from building accessible web apps? You'll get a high level overview of fundamental issues, how to address them, and how to ensure your website is accessible and inclusive to all.
